# 🌪 Vortex Power Blueprint

**An open-source, next-generation energy system using nested vortices, magnetic fields, vacuum dynamics, and sacred geometry.**

---

## ✨ Overview

The **Vortex Power Blueprint** is part of the WePower initiative, aiming to explore perpetual and regenerative energy using a unique configuration:

- Magnetic bearings and field logic
- Vacuum-sealed vortex chambers
- Fibonacci spiral copper windings
- Environmental sensors and feedback
- Optional wireless energy transmission
- AI-tuned magnetic pulses
- Sacred geometry (e.g., Chestahedron, Torus)
